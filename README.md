# AlaiCodingChallenge

This project generates an entire presentation based on a website you provide. The main work file is **work.py**. Running this file will prompt you for a website URL; the script will then scrape the website content and generate a presentation along with its access link.

## Files

- **work.py**  
  This is the main file you need to run. It prompts you for a website URL, scrapes its content, and then creates and configures a presentation. Finally, it prints out the link where you can view the presentation.

- **scrape.py**  
  This file was used as a test to check the functionality of the Firecrawl library for website scraping. It is not part of the main presentation generation workflow.

- **.env**  
  Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your authorization token here. For example:


Note that the other files are temporary and only for debugging purposes.
